# About Me

Welcome to my blog on all things Product Management and Data. Here you will find musings (hopefully with some slight humour) and projects (both completed and upcoming).

Currently I work as a Technical Product Manager at Risilience, a startup working to quantify and strategise climate related risks for clients. Historically, I worked on data related problems (both the sexy stuff and the plumbing) across various startups and consulting practices.

## Professional Background

- **Data Engineering & Analytics**
- **Machine Learning & AI**
- **Product Strategy & Development**
- **Climate Risk Quantification**

## Current Role

At **Risilience**, I work as a Technical Product Manager focusing on:
- Data Visualisation and Reporting
- Data ingestion and related problems

## Previous Experience

I've worked across various startups and consulting practices, tackling data-related problems from both the "sexy" analytical side and the essential "plumbing" infrastructure side.
